Introduction to Alogrithms   and Arrays :--

diff b/w return and end statements in algo
the return statement terminates the current function and return value while end terminates the main function in class in algo.


Complexity of Algorithms:-
1)Time Complexity:- Amount of time taken by Algo. to complete the tasks is called Time Complexity.
2)Space Complexity:- Amount of space taken by Algo. to Complete the task.


Big O Notation :- 
This is the mathematical notation to evaluate the algo.
This is to observe the behaviour of space and time complexities as input grows.

for(i=0;i<10;i++) -- here O(10) will be there not O(n) so we can sat O(1) also if asked because constant is there

Single and 2d Arrays:-----------------

1)Function :- A function is a sequence of program instructions that performs a specific task.

Types of function:-
1)Standard Library Function
2)User-defined functions

1)Standard Library Functions- They are inbuilt functions that are present within the programming language
In c :- strlen(),strcpy() amd strcat()
In java:-print(),sqrt(),pow() etc

2)User defined function- they are define by the user inorder to perfom some specific task.

What is an IDE?
IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment, it is a special type of software which helps in writing, editing , compiling and executing the program of a particular programming language.

1d array int arr[9]; in c 
int arr[]=new int[9];   Here 9 is length of array. 
in java in braces there is subsript or index  0,12,----8

In c if we want upto 2 dp :-  %.2f can be used

%lf -- for doouble type is uded
%d -- for int

Binary Search:- For binary search the element has to be arranged either in ascending or descending order then only binary search can be applied.

linear search - For linear search for searching the ordewr doesnt matter.


Interchange of variables:-- 5methods
1) int temp=a, a=b, b=temp;
2) a= a+b; b=a-b; a=a-b;
3)a=a*b, b=a/b , a=a/b;
4)a=a^b , b=a^b , a=a^b;
5) single b=a+b-(a=b);

Bubble Sort :- In bubble sort adjacent element are coompared for eg in first loop 0,1 compared then 1,2 and so on 
In second same process is repeated 0,1 and 1,2 and so on.

Selection Sort:-In selection firsst element is compared with all other elements and the shortest and one is then find out.
Foor eg in first iteration that is 0th the 0 th elementis compared with in order 0,1 and 0,2 and then 0,3 and soo oon
Now again 1,2 and 1,3 and so on....

A sorting technique with n-1 elements logic is called bubble sort or slection sort
